# Signal Processing Frequency Analysis

## Description
This project is designed for audio signal processing and frequency analysis. It processes audio segments, analyzes their frequency content, and visualizes the results. The project includes functionalities for filtering, noise analysis, and generating various plots to represent the audio signals.

## Features
- Load and process audio signals from WAV files.
- Perform frequency spectrum analysis and power spectral density calculations.
- Visualize time-domain signals, frequency spectra, and filter responses.
- Evaluate noise levels in audio segments.

## Installation
To set up the project, clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aimldlnlp/denoising-noise-audio.git
cd denoising-noise-audio
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
1. Place your audio files in the `dataset/` directory.
2. Run the main processing script:

```bash
python main.py
```

3. The results will be saved in the `results/` directory, including filtered audio, frequency spectrum plots, and noise analysis results.
